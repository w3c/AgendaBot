# TODO: When given a -c option, agendabot loads all passwords into
# memory. It should either not keep them in memory permanently, or
# encrypt them.
#
# TODO: Fix information leak: Agendabot will extract an agenda from
# any resource it has a password for, even if the person asking for
# the agenda wouldn't be able to read that agenda himself.
# The only current protection is that Agendabot will only retrieve
# password-protected resources if asked on a server-local channel (one
# starting with "&"), and not if asked on a public channel (starting
# with "#") or in a private message.
#
# TODO: Judy's idea: after a meeting, defer remaining agenda items to
# the next meeting. (Or is that more something for Zakim?)
#
# TODO: If the nick is already in use, try again with a different one.
#
# TODO: Don't join a channel if there is another instance of AgendaBot
# already.
#
# TODO: Show the agenda and ask for confirmation before putting it in
# Zakim's format. (Vivien's idea.)
#
# TODO: Automatically part a channel after a certain period of
# inactivity?
#
# TODO: The list of security exceptions is searched with linear search.
# That's only fine if the list is short.
#
# TODO: Add a way to test the heuristic parsers without connecting to
# IRC.
#
# TODO: The associations of channels with mailing list archives should
# allow for channels on different IRC networks.
#
# TODO: Do more operations that involve HTTP requests in the
# background.
#
# TODO: More intelligent and configurable $maxtries.
#
# TODO: Allow "... in the last week" instead of "in the last 1 weeks".
#
# TODO: Skip useless links. Use the anchor text instead of downloading
# and then looking for the subject.
#
# TODO: Automatically start looking for an agenda when Zakim joins the
# channel?
#
# TODO: Agendabot doesn't find the agenda in
# https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Team/w3t-comm/2022Jan/0059.html but
# the list of links added by hypermail. Explicitly ignore those? Look
# inside quoted text?
#
# TODO: The EPUB3 WG (Dave Cramer and Wendy Reid) write agendas like this:

=head1 NAME

agendabot - IRC 'bot that gets a meeting agenda from a URL

=head1 SYNOPSIS

agendabot [-n I<nick>] [-N I<name>] [-c I<passwordfile>] [-e I<URL>]
[-m I<associations-file>] [-r rejoin-file] [-C charset] [-v] I<URL>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Agendabot is an IRC 'bot. It connects to the IRC server given by the
URL (e.g., "irc://irc.example.org/"), waits until it is /invite'd to
one or more channels and then watches those channels for lines of the
form

 agenda: URL

(where URL is an arbitrary URL) and tries to find a meeting agenda at that
URL. If it succeeds in finding an agenda, it prints it on IRC in a
form suitable for the Zakim 'bot, i.e., it prints something like:

 clear agenda
 agenda+ TOPIC1
 agenda+ TOPIC2

It tries various parsers in turn to read the document and uses the
results of the parser that recognized the most agenda topics. (See
L</"Agenda formats"> below.)

=head2 W3C mail archives and W3C group calendars

You can also tell agendabot to search for agendas in a W3C mail
archive or a W3C group calendar and let it discover the URL of the
agenda by itself. First you need to tell agendabot where to search
with a command such as this:

 agendabot, this is i18n-core

You only need to do this once. Agendabot will find the relevant
mailing lists and calendars and remember them, even when it
disconnects and later reconnects to the same channel. Thereafter you
only need to say

 agendabot, find agenda

and agendabot will respond with the URL of the agenda and the agenda
itself (or a message that it didn't find any agenda)

=head2 Specifying the IRC server

The I<URL> argument specifies the server to connect to. It must be of
the following form:

=over

I<protocol>://I<username>:I<password>@I<server>:I<port>/I<channel>

=back

But many parts are optional. The I<protocol> must be either "irc" or
"ircs", the latter for an SSL-encrypted connection.

If the I<username> is omitted, the I<password> and the "@" must also
be omitted. If a I<username> is given, but the I<password> is omitted,
agendabot will prompt for it. (But if both the ":" and the I<password>
are omitted, agendabot assumes that no password is needed.)

The I<server> is required.

If the ":" and the I<port> are omitted, the port defaults to 6667 (for
irc) or 6697 (for ircs).

If a I<channel> is given, agendabot will join that channel (in
addition to any channels it rejoins, see the B<-r> option). If the
I<channel> does not start with a "#" or a "&", agendabot will add a
"#" itself.

Omitting the password is useful to avoid that the password is visible
in the list of running processes or that somebody can read it over
your shoulder while you type the command.

Note that many characters in the username or password must be
URL-escaped. E.g., a "@" must be written as "%40", ":" must be written
as "%3a", "/" as "%2f", etc.

=head2 IRC commands

For more details about the commands agendabot understands on IRC, see
the manual, or use the "agendabot, help" command on IRC. Here is a
brief list:

=over

=item "/invite agendabot"

When agendabot is invited to a channel, it tries to join that channel.

=item" agenda: I<URL>"

Makes agendabot try and retrieve the URL, parse the result to try and
find an agenda, and print that agenda on IRC in the right format for
Zakim 'bot. Agendabot prints an error message if it fails to find an
agenda.

=item "agendabot, bye"

Tells agendabot to leave the current channel.

=item "agendabot, help" and "agendabot help I<command>"

Ask agendabot to give a brief description of itself. To get
information about a specific command, such as "find", type "agendabot,
help find".

=item "agendabot, find agenda"

Ask agendabot to look in the mail archives and the W3C group calendar
for an agenda. It looks
back one week. To search other periods, add a number of days or weeks,
e.g.: "agendabot, find agenda since 10 days".

=item "agendabot, suggest agenda"

Ask agendabot to look in the mail archives for messages that have
"agenda+" in their subject. It looks for message less than one week
old. To search other periods, add a number of days or weeks, e.g.,
"agendabot, suggest agenda since 2 weeks".

=item "agendabot, accept"

Ask agendabot to turn the suggested agenda into an actual agenda.

=item "agendabot, this is I<name>" and "agendabot, this is I<URL>"

Tell agendabot in what mailing list or calendar to search for
agendas. The short
form, e.g., "agendabot, this is style" or "agendabot, this is w3t",
causes agendabot to guess the URL. In this case, it will find
".../Public/www-style/" and ".../Team/w3t". (It may not have access to
password-protected archives, see the B<-c> option.)

Note that a short name may resolve to multiple mailing lists and
calendars. E.g., "i18n-core" is the name of a calendar
"...groups/wg/i18n-core/calendar", and two mailing lists,
"...Member/member-i18n-core/", and "...Public/public-i18n-core/". If
agendabot finds too many sources to search in, use the full URLs
instead.

You may give multiple names and URLs, separated by commas or the word
"and". E.g.: "agendabot, this is foo and bar". Agendabot will search
in all given mailing lists and calendars.

=item "agendabot, forget"

Ask agendabot to forget the mailing lists and calendars for this
channel. Subsequent "find" and "suggest" commands will fail, until a
new mailing list or calendar is set with the "this is" command.

=item "agendabot, status"

Ask agendabot to display the URL of the mailing lists and calendars
where it searches for agendas.

=back

All commands can be normal messages or "/me" messages.

Once started, the bot doesn't stop (unless a serious error occurs).
Stop it with Control-C or the kill(1) command.

=head2 Agenda formats

Agendabot currently recognizes agendas written in one of the following
forms. The document in which the agenda sits may be plain text, XHTML,
HTML, HTML5, XML (text/xml only), or any text format that is close to
plain text.

=over

=item 1.

In this format, agenda topics are lines that start with a number and a
period and are followed by a line starting with at least four dashes.
E.g.:

 1. Welcome
 ----------

 2. The apple tree
 ----------

 3. AOB
 ------

Any text before, after or in between these lines is ignored. The above
results in the following agenda:

 clear agenda
 agenda+ Welcome
 agenda+ The apple tree
 agenda+ AOB

=item 2.

This format requires the text "=== AGENDA ===" (upper- or lowercase and
possibly with more "=" signs) to occur in the document. All agenda
topics are lines that start with "Topic:". E.g.:

 ==== AGENDA ====

 Topic: AOB?

 Topic: Radar

Any text before, after or in between these lines is ignored. The above
results in the following agenda:

 clear agenda
 agenda+ AOB?
 agenda+ Radar

=item 3.

This format is simply the same as the output, apart from any redundant
whitespace. I.e., topics are lines that start with "agenda+". E.g.:

 agenda+ Roundtable
 agenda+ TPAC registration
 agenda+ Next meeting

Any text before, after or in between these lines is ignored. The above
results in the following agenda:

 clear agenda
 agenda+ Roundtable
 agenda+ TPAC registration
 agenda+ Next meeting

=item 4.

This format has the word "Agenda" somewhere in the text and there may
be topics and subtopics, which start with start with a "1)", "1.",
"*", "•", "-", "◦" or "⁃". Only the top level markers, the least indented,
are copied.

 Agenda telcon 20 July
 0. Extra agenda items and other digressions
    * Jan's items
    * Scribes
 1. [css-display] Blockifications
 2. [cssom-1] Replace steps of set a CSS declaration

Any text before, after or in between these lines is ignored. The above
results in the following agenda:

 clear agenda
 agenda+ Extra agenda items and other digressions
 agenda+ [css-display] Blockifications
 agenda+ [cssom-1] Replace steps of set a CSS declaration</pre>

=back

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item B<-n> I<nick>

The nickname the bot runs under. Default is "agendabot".

=item B<-N> I<name>

The real name of the bot. Default is "AgendaBot".

=item B<-c> I<passwordfile>

I<passwordfile> is a file with login names, passwords and cookies for
various servers. When agendabot is trying to retrieve a document over
HTTP and receives an authentication request, it looks in this
file. The file must contain lines with four tab-separated
fields: host:port, realm, login and password. The
port is required. Empty lines and lines that start with "#" are
ignored. Other lines cause an error. E.g.:

 # This is a password file
 example.org:443	Member login/passw	joe	secret
 info.example.org:443	Member login/passw	joe	secret

The passwords column can be encrypted with a passphrase. To indicate
that it is indeed encrypted, include a line "!encrypted", e.g., like
this:

 # This is a password file with encrypted passwords
 !encrypted
 example.org:443	Member login/passw	joe	34AF323AA218928
 info.example.org:443	Member login/passw	joe	125656340CD0990

When agendabot starts, it will prompt for the passphrase to decrypt
the passwords.

The password file must be in UTF-8.

=item B<-e> I<URL>

Normally, agendabot only uses the password file (option B<-c>) when it
is asked to retrieve an agenda on a server-local channel, i.e., a
channel that starts with "&". It will refuse to retrieve
password-protected agendas on public channels or in private messages.
The B<-e> option points to a list of exceptions. Each line in the
indicated file consists of a channel name and a URL prefix, separated
by a tab. If a URL is asked for on a channel and the channel name and
the URL match a line in this file, agendabot will try to retrieve the
agenda, even if it is password-protected. Empty lines and lines
that start with "# " are ignored. E.g.:

 # Security exceptions
 #i18n	https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/member-i18n-core/

The file with exceptions may itself be password-protected. Note that
it is a URL, not a file name. To refer to a local file, use a "file:".

=item B<-m> I<associations-file>

When IRC channels are associated with mailing lists and calendars (so
that agendabot
knows which archives to search for agendas), those associations are
stored in a file. This way, when agendabot is restarted, it still
knows the associations. This option specifies the file. The default is
agendabot.assoc.

The file contains lines consisting of three parts separated by tabs: a
channel name, a space-separated list of URLs, and the type of the
association (mailing list or calendar). Empty lines are ignored and
lines that
start with "#" but not with a valid channel name are considered
comments and are also ignored. But note that the file will be
overwritten and the comments will be lost as soon as agendabot
receives a new mailing list or calendar association on IRC.

=item B<-r> I<rejoin-file>

If the option B<-r> is given, agendabot joins the channels in
I<rejoin-file> as soon as it connects to the server, without having to
be invited. It updates the file when it is invited to an additional
channel or is dismissed from one. This way, when agendabot is stopped
and then restarted (with the same B<-r> option), it will automatically
rejoin the channels it was on when it was stopped.

=item B<C> I<charset>

Set the character encoding for messages. This should match what the
IRC server expects. The default is utf8.

=item B<-v>

Be verbose. Makes the 'bot print a log to standard error output of
what it is doing.

=back

=head1 BUGS

Parsing of XHTML/HTML/HTML5/XML is not complete. In particular
occurrences of E<lt> or E<gt> in attributes or CDATA sections may
cause missed or false matches.

The character encoding of an HTML file may be wrong, if it is declared
with a C<meta> element and is different from that set by the HTTP
header C<Content-Type>. Agendabot only uses the latter.

The current parsers in agendabot will try to parse any other text/*
format as if it was plain text, which may give strange results. E.g.,
text/enriched may have formatting codes such as E<lt>bold> or
E<lt>italic>, which are not removed.

=head1 NOTES

This was a 2018 Geek Week project. The idea for the program is due to
Richard Ishida.
